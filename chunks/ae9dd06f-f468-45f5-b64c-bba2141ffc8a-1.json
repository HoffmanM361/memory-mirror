The app then automatically downloads and caches map tiles for their specific region, enabling offline use.\r\n• Precise Digital Boundary Mapping: Using the phone's native GPS, users can walk the perimeter of their farm or mining claim offline to create a precise digital boundary, which is saved locally. GPS satellites work anywhere, anytime, without internet or cell service.\r\n• Identity Verification: Users complete a profile by taking a selfie and capturing photos of identity or land-claim paperwork, linking a person to a specific GPS-defined property.\r\n• First Synchronization & Foundational Record: When internet access is available, a single \"UPLOAD\" button securely transmits the mapped boundaries and identity data, creating their foundational record.\r\n• Product Security & Geotagging: Farmers/miners lock produce or minerals with uniquely numbered security tags and photograph them using the app. These photos are automatically geotagged, creating an unchangeable link between the product, a time, and a location on their registered property.\r\n• Data Upload & Permanent Linking: All new verification data is uploaded during the next internet sync and permanently linked to the product's record.\r\n• Public Verification: Anyone with the unique number from the security tag can instantly verify the product's origin and quality.\r\n• Core Technology Foundation: iVerify is built upon a robust, pre-existing mapping and reporting application that has been field-tested, demonstrating core capabilities like offline GPS mapping, photo integration, data sync, and multi-format report generation.\r\n• Secure Data Ledger: The system stores GPS and production data in a secure, blockchain-style ledger that creates an unchangeable record.\r\n• Local Data Ownership: A critical advantage is that this data is owned by the national partner (typically t"
