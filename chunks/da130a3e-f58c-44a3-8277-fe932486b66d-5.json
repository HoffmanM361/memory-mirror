This MOU positions the City and County to lead a region-wide model for housing\r\nand riverfront renewal.\r\nWhy It Benefits Mississippi: Eagles Flock to Woodstock is not only a breakthrough for Hattiesburg—it is a\r\nproof-of-concept for municipalities across Mississippi seeking to tackle housing, infrastructure, and resilience\r\nchallenges in tandem.\r\nThis initiative introduces a scalable business model that can be replicated in flood-prone or underutilized land near\r\nwastewater treatment plants, rivers, and drainage corridors—common conditions across Mississippi’s rural towns\r\nand urban peripheries.\r\nStatewide Benefits\r\n• Scalable, Resilient Housing: By using elevated modular construction with permanent foundations, the\r\nmodel provides safe, affordable homes in areas previously deemed “unbuildable” due to floodplain risk—\r\nwithout increasing municipal exposure to long-term emergency response or infrastructure costs.\r\n• Infrastructure Optimization: Co-locating housing with existing wastewater and utility infrastructure\r\nallows cities to increase density without expanding costly service boundaries. This optimizes capital\r\ninvestments made in water, sewer, and treatment systems—especially in regions experiencing slow growth\r\nor budget constraints.\r\n• Climate-Ready Design: All homes are built to IRC 2021 standards with optional floodproofing, solar\r\npanels, rainwater catchment, and high-efficiency HVAC—making them eligible for HUD, FEMA, USDA,\r\nand EPA climate and mitigation programs.\r\n• Economic Impact in Disadvantaged Areas: Replicating the model in Historically Disadvantaged\r\nCommunities (HDCs) will create jobs in modular home manu"
