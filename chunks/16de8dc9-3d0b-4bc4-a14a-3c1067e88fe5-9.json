Security Release: Authorized personnel use specific release magnet at designated contact points2. Gesture Sequence: Perform required motion (lift, twist, pull combination) to disengage magnetic\r\nlocks\r\n3. Panel Removal: Two workers lift backrest panel from vertical position (panel may weigh 20-50\r\npounds depending on construction)\r\n4. Horizontal Positioning: Panel repositioned horizontally on seat platform with leveling ribs facing up\r\n5. Alignment: Panel positioned to ensure ribs properly compensate for seat angle, creating level\r\nsurface\r\n6. Bedding Deployment: If stored under seat, release cargo straps and unfold mattresses onto level\r\nsurface\r\n7. Final Securing: Mattresses positioned and secured by friction, body weight, or optional attachment\r\npoints\r\nConversion time may be 30-90 seconds per unit with trained personnel in various embodiments.\r\nQuality Control During Deployment:\r\nVisual inspection that leveling ribs create proper horizontal surface\r\nCheck that bedding lies flat without gaps or raised areas\r\nVerify personal storage compartments are accessible\r\nConfirm all magnetic release tools are secured/tethered\r\nSleeping to Seating Conversion: The reverse process returns the unit to seating configuration:\r\n1. Bedding Removal: Fold and secure mattresses to under-seat storage or remove to separate storage\r\n2. Panel Repositioning: Lift backrest panel and return to vertical position in end s"
