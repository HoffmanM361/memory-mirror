Some professionals may perform this work as a marketing investment, potentially reducing costs substantially. However, we should budget for full market rates until such relationships are confirmed.\r\nObjective\r\nDevelop component-level budgets and confirm technical and financial feasibility for the validated unit mix model through professional engineering and architectural analysis, with holistic consideration of the entire site including grounds and horizontal development.\r\nKey Activities\r\nInternal Cost Analysis\r\nExecute detailed SIP cost tool analysis for the validated unit mix\r\nGenerate Low/Expected/High cost scenarios for comprehensive risk assessment\r\nPrepare internal budgets and work orders "
