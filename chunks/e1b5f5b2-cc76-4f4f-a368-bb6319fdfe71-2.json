The materials aren't expensive - foam and OSB/MgO are cheap. With 160 units\r\nwe have volume leverage.\r\nBenefits of SIP panels:\r\n● Superior energy efficiency (can include utilities and profit from the difference)\r\n● Modern construction appeals to investors\r\n● Enhanced returns for investors through utility savings\r\n● Volume pricing should drive costs down to competitive levels\r\nPath 2: Stick-Built (Backup)\r\nIf we can't get SIP pricing down, we can go stick-built with local contractors. Won't be as energy\r\nefficient but still works financially.\r\nTarget Construction Costs\r\nMethod Cost/SF Notes\r\nSIP Panels (Volume) $130-140/SF Target through volume negotiations\r\nStick-Built $120-130/SF Backup if SIP pricing doesn't work\r\nKey Points\r\n● Volume benefits pricing - Everything works better at scale\r\n● Utility strategy - SIP efficiency allows us to charge flat fee and profit\r\n● Condominiumization - Doesn't have to look like condos, just be condos legally\r\n● Market validation - Deposits go in escrow, provides downside protection\r\n● Cluster development - Mix of unit sizes, natural layout\r\n● Strong demand - Both student housing and workforce housing are excellent markets\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\n© North Star Group, Inc. 2025 All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n19901 Quail Circle\r\nFairhope AL 36532\r\n<redacted.phone>\r\n<redacted.email>\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA_Leaf River Cluster Development - SIP Panel Condominium Project\r\n\r\nUnit Mix & Pricing\r\nSIP Panel Construction at $135/SF\r\nUnit Type Square Feet Units Construction Cost Sale Price*\r\nEfficiency 480 40 $64,800 $105,000\r\n2BR 750 40 $1"
