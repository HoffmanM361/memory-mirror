  "content": "er-Term Revenue Conversion (Weeks 9–12)\r\nBy the final third of the 90-day plan, the goal is to convert pipeline opportunities into signed\r\nagreements:\r\n• Secure at least one formal design facilitation or grant consulting agreement tied to a\r\nrefuge-capable building project.\r\n• Negotiate distribution or licensing terms for the convertible pew design with at least one\r\nmanufacturer.\r\n• Pursue at least one government or philanthropic grant application where Northstar is paid\r\nfor preparing and submitting the package.\r\n• Document all projects in a portfolio format for marketing to additional prospects.\r\n4. Financial Targets &amp; Cash Flow Goals\r\n\r\nThe following are conservative targets for the 90-day window:\r\n• $10,000–$20,000 from consulting/facilitation fees (scope-of-work, grant facilitation).\r\n• $5,000–$15,000 from manufacturer referral commissions or design licensing.\r\n• $25,000+ in pending receivables from signed contracts initiated during the 90-day\r\nwindow.\r\n• Pipeline value of $250,000+ in prospective projects where Northstar is positioned for a\r\nshare of revenue.\r\n5. Key Risks &amp; Mitigations\r\n• Risk: Delay in securing a signed contract – Mitigation: Diversify prospects, keep active\r\ncontact with multiple contractors and manufacturers.\r\n• Risk: Grant eligibility or timing issues – Mitigation: Identify multiple funding streams and\r\nstay flexible in matching them to projects.\r\n• Risk: Over-reliance on one project (RTS Chapel) – Mitigation: Use RTS concept as a model,\r\nnot a dependency."
