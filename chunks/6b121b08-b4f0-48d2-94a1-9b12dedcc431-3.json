With Huntsville being Alabama's fastest-growing city and experiencing significant workforce growth in aerospace, defense, and tech sectors, along with a housing affordability score that has dropped from 98 to 95 What Will The Housing Market Look Like In Huntsville, Alabama In 2025? - TechBullion, there's clearly a need for innovative housing solutions that serve both the growing workforce and affordable housing residents.\r\nUnlike traditional approaches, this model doesn't rely on Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, making it more straightforward to implement.\r\nKey Benefits:\r\n\r\nDeveloper fee revenue directly to your housing authority\r\nVery low-cost affordable housing production\r\nHigh, consistent cash flow generation\r\nFollows best practices for public housing authorities that have diversified their portfolio, which according to Novogradac CPA firm are \"in much better shape to weather potential storms\" and demonstrate \"the power of diversification and the power of a growth mindset in terms of trying to provide housing needs in a variety of ways and not solely reliant on HUD funding\"\r\n\r\nThe model addresses Huntsville's current challenge where 74% of new housing units are rentals, potentially limiting homeownership opportunities, by creating a mixed-income structure that serves both workforce homebuyers and affordable rental residents.\r\nWould you be open to a brief call to discuss how this might work for Huntsville's growing market? Please see the attached PDF explainer document for details on the financial structure and implementation approach.\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Hoffman\r\nNorth Star Group, Inc.\r\nFairhope, AL 36532\r\n<redacted.email>\r\n<redacted.phone>\r\nAttachme"
