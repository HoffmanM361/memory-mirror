The engineering is solid, the user experience is functional, and the core value proposition is clear. This is exactly the right time to implement a freemium model and start learning from paying customers.\r\n\r\nThe 30-use limit creates natural urgency without being punitive, the $5 price point is low enough to minimize decision friction but high enough to filter for committed users, and the implementation path leverages all your existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nI recommend proceeding with the freemium implementation immediately. The market validation and revenue data you'll gather over the next 90 days will inform all future technical and product decisions much more effectively than architectural speculation.\r\n\r\nYour system is ready. Your users are ready. The market is ready. Let's monetize this solution and start building a sustainable business around the value you've already created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems like that the login itself make become frictional that the premium model the free side of the model might not need to require a two-factor Authentication but if they decide to pay for it then we need to up our level of security I'm just talking I'm asking cuz we have this unusual way of having a photo attached and I'm afraid that we're going to lose some users but once they're in they're in and that will be that'll be stickier\r\n\r\nEdit\r\nYou've identified a critical UX friction point! The photo-based 2FA is definitely unusual and could be driving away potential free users who just want to try the system quickly. Here's a strategic approach:\r\n\r\nTiered Authentication Strategy\r\nFree Tier: Friction-Free Entry\r\nEmail + Password only (traditional signup)\r\nNo photo requirement for free accounts\r\n30 conversations max - enough to evaluate value\r\nQuick onboarding - \"Start saving conversations in 30 seconds\"\r\nPaid Tier: Enhanced Security\r\nPhoto-based 2FA required when upgrading to paid\r\nJustify "
