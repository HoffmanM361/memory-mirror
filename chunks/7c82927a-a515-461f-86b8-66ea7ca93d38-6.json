The Community Reinvestment Act provides additional leverage, as banks are required to help meet credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, with over $3 trillion in CRA-qualifying mortgages and small business loans made from 2009-2020. Banks account for 85% of Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) investment dollars, primarily driven by CRA compliance requirements. This creates a compelling value proposition combining financial returns, social impact, regulatory compliance benefits, and community reinvestment objectives.\r\n\r\nInvestment Summary\r\nPhase\r\nFocus Area\r\nBudget Range\r\nPhase 1\r\nData Gathering Workshop\r\n$3,500\r\nPhase 2\r\nUnit Mix Development\r\n$1,500\r\nPhase 3\r\nFeasibility Analysis\r\n$35,000\r\nPhase 4\r\nWebsite Development\r\n$28,000\r\nPhase 5\r\nMarket Activation\r\n$1,500 - $30,000*\r\n\r\nTotal Investment Range:\r\nExpected: $69,500\r\nActive Development  option with business developer on site: $98,000\r\n*Phase 5 budget depends on scope: $1,500 for supporting documentation role, $30,000 for active business development\r\n\r\nImplementation Timeline\r\nWeeks 1-2: Phases 1-2 (Data gathering workshops and unit mix development)\r\n Weeks 3-4: Phase 3 (Feasibility analysis and technical validation)\r"
