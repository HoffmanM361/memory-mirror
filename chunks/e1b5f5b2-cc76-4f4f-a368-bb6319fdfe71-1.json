  "content": "elopment groups buildings naturally around common areas and\r\npreserves green space, rather than organizing units in rigid rows like traditional subdivisions. This\r\napproach reduces infrastructure costs by minimizing road networks and utility runs while creating\r\na more appealing, community-oriented environment. The natural layout works particularly well\r\nwith waterfront properties, maintaining river access and scenic views.\r\nVolume purchasing will drive better pricing across all systems and materials. The utility\r\nmanagement strategy makes particular sense for investor sales - charging a flat utility fee while\r\nbenefiting from SIP efficiency creates additional revenue streams. Cluster development helps\r\nwith the elevated pier foundations required for flood compliance.\r\nConstruction costs for workforce housing typically range $120-140 per square foot, while SIP\r\nconstruction commands higher pricing but Randy believes volume orders can achieve\r\ncompetitive rates. A professional sales office with 3D site renderings and quality presentation\r\nmaterials will demonstrate projected returns to potential investors.\r\nBoth student housing and workforce housing represent excellent market opportunities with\r\nsurprisingly robust demand. Well-constructed, attractive units should achieve rapid sellout given\r\nthe substantial unmet need in the Hattiesburg market.\r\n\r\nDevelopment Structure\r\nThere are many approaches to building and selling housing developments, but the condominium\r\nstructure seems most attractive for this project because the demand is there which should allow\r\npre-sales, and the individual unit ownership makes financing easier on the real estate developers\r\nand property owners.\r\n\r\nProject Overview\r\n160 Individual Condominium Units for Sale\r\nCluster-style development using SIP (Structural Insulated Panel) construction. Natural layout\r\npreserving green space and river access.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nÂ© North Star Group, Inc. 2025 All rights r"
