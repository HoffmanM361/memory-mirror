After reviewing your materials, I see strong alignment between your elevated panelized systems and our flood-resilient housing and regenerative infrastructure model. It was a pleasure speaking with you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEagles Flock to Woodstock LLC is a Mississippi-based land development firm committed to eco-forward housing, conservation, and economic revitalization. Our pilot project involves the development of 60–70 elevated homes across 32.9 acres along the Leaf River in Hattiesburg, MS. Just 40 feet from the East Hardy Street Bridge, this property sits at the center of the proposed $18M federally funded Leaf River Active Transportation Network—placing our initiative at the nexus of sustainable community development and public infrastructure investment. As part of the site, a 2.98-acre tract directly connected to the larger 29.9-acre development zone will be developed into a freshwater marina—complete with a boat ramp and bait shop—serving as a catalyst for local recreation, eco-tourism, and year-round economic activity along the riverfront.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVision & Mission\r\n\r\nVision: To transform overlooked lands into regenerative, affordable housing communities rooted in sustainability, resilience, and place.\r\nMission: To build flood-resilient homes and launch new housing markets through direct development, branded distribution, and circular water-based infrastructure.\r\n \r\n\r\nKey Components\r\n\r\nElevated Housing Model: Built on 6-foot pier foundations to withstand flood-prone terrain, cost-efficient, structurally sound, and rapidly deployable.\r\nFreshwater Marina: Integrated on the 2.98-acre tract, the marina will enhance economic use of the Leaf River through strategic public access infrastructure, increasing community engagement and recreational value.\r\nEcoFlow Hattiesburg: A phased, nature-based infrast"
