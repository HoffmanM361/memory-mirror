Exploration of this structure with qualified developers\r\n2. Formation of the three entities as described\r\n3. Staff time to pursue financing applications\r\n4. Legal review to confirm compliance\r\nThis is not a commitment to build - it's permission to fully develop this opportunity.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis structure solves multiple problems with one coordinated solution:\r\n● Working families get homes they can afford to buy\r\n● Lower-income families get quality apartments with stable rents\r\n● The Housing Authority generates significant cash flow\r\n● No taxpayer subsidies needed\r\n● Creates mixed-income community, not concentrated poverty\r\nThe math works. The structure is legal. The need is urgent. The opportunity is now.\r\nBy using profits from workforce housing to support affordable apartments, we create a\r\nself-sustaining model that serves our entire community. This isn't complex financial engineering -\r\nit's simple business logic applied to public benefit.\r\n\r\n__________________________"
