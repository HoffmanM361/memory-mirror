This positions us to capture Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment mandates and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) funding opportunities in a high-demand, reasonably-priced market.\r\nThe plan emphasizes visual storytelling throughout—following the principle that \"a picture is worth a thousand words\"—combining professional engineering and architectural work with explanatory imagery that brings our vision to life for both administrators and community members. The goal is to prepare an institutional-quality presentation that generates institutional interest in a high-demand market while maintaining economic viability.\r\nTarget Timeline: 6 weeks from kickoff to website launch\r\n Investment Range: $46,500 - $61,500\r\n\r\nPhase 1: Stakeholder Mix Workshop\r\nData Gathering & Scenario Framework\r\nObjective\r\nGather the essential data needed to develop viable unit mix options through co"
