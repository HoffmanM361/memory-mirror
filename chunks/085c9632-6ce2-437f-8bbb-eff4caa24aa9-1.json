The goal is to provide clarity on the process so that all parties understand what is being delivered and what is needed to complete the work.\r\n1. What is HEC-RAS?\r\nHEC-RAS stands for 'Hydrologic Engineering Center - River Analysis System'. It is software developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to model river and stream hydraulics. For a No-Rise Certification, HEC-RAS is used to predict how a proposed development will affect water surface elevations during flood events.\r\n2. FEMA Requirements for No-Rise Certification\r\nIn a FEMA-designated floodway, any proposed development must demonstrate that it will not cause an increase in the base flood elevation (BFE). This is called a 'No-Rise Certification'. FEMA requires this certification to be supported by a hydraulic model comparing existing conditions and proposed conditions.\r\n3. Files and Data Used in HEC-RAS Modeling\r\nThe model is built from specific input files and data sources, including:\r\n- FEMA Effective Model: The official hydraulic model from FEMAâ€™s database.\r\n- Topographic Data: Surveyed ground elevations for the site and surrounding area.\r\n- Cross Section Geometry Files (.g01, .g02, etc.): Define the shape of the river and floodplain.\r\n- Flow Files (.f01, .f02): Contain discharge rates for different flood events.\r\n- Plan Files (.p01, .p02): Define scenarios such as 'Existing' and 'Proposed' conditions.\r\n- Output Files: Generated by HEC-RAS to show water surface elevations, velocities, and impacts.\r\n4. Step-by-Step Process\r\nThe typical process for preparing a No-Rise Certification model includes:\r\n1. Request FEMA Effective Model for the project area.\r\n2. Import FEMA model int"
