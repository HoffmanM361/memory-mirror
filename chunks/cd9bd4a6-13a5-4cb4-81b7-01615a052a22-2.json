For $3/month, get a personal, secure memory\r\nnode that any assistant can read. It preserves your work across chats and models, without\r\nlock-in. Set up once, use everywhere.\r\nFAQ (Brief)\r\nQ: What if AI vendors block web fetch?\r\nA: We’ll attempt to adapt (e.g., through a relay or packaged context files). If no solution\r\nworks, you can export your data and cancel anytime.\r\nQ: Is my data public?\r\nA: Only redacted mirrors are public and nonce-protected; full data is private in your DB.\r\nQ: Can I self-host?\r\nA: Yes, via the $35 DIY kit. You can move between hosted and DIY at any time."
