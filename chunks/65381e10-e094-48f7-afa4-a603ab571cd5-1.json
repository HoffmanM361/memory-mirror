Based on industry standards for floodway projects of this scope:\r\n\r\n- **Traditional Engineer-Only Approach:** $15,000 - $25,000\r\n- **Our Blended Approach:** $10,000 - $15,000 total project cost\r\n- **Your Savings:** $5,000 - $10,000\r\n\r\n### Timeline Acceleration\r\n- **Parallel Processing** - Survey, data collection, and modeling happen simultaneously rather than sequentially\r\n- **Ready-to-Certify Package** - Engineer receives complete analysis requiring only review and stamp\r\n- **Reduced Permitting Delays** - All prerequisite documentation assembled in advance\r\n\r\n### Risk Mitigation\r\n- **No-Rise Feasibility** - Preliminary modeling identifies potential issues before costly engineering commitments\r\n- **Regulatory Compliance** - Deep familiarity with FEMA, Mississippi, and Hattiesburg requirements\r\n- **Buildable Area Optimization** - Data-driven approach to maximize development potential within floodway constraints\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Specific Deliverables\r\n\r\n### Technical Package\r\n1. **FEMA Model Analysis** - Preliminary hydraulic model with existing and proposed conditions\r\n2. **Regulatory Compliance Checklist** - Specific requirements for Hattiesburg and Forrest County\r\n3. **Survey Requirements Document** - Exact specifications for topographic and boundary work\r\n4. **Professional Scopes of Work** - Detailed task descriptions for engineer and surveyor contracts\r\n\r\n### Planning Package\r\n1. **Site Analysis** - Preliminary buildable area assessment\r\n2. **Zoning Strategy** - Pathway for A-1 to Camp/Lodge conversion\r\n3. **Utility Options** - Infrastructure alternatives and requirements\r\n4. **Permit Roadmap** - Step-by-step process with responsible parties identified\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Proje"
