Approach: Run four parallel\r\nworkstreams—Manufacturer (pews), Contractor (church GCs with SIP capability), Grants\r\n(safe room/refuge funding), and MapArea (tooling + deliverables). Fees are fixed‑price (not\r\na % of grants). Outputs include quotes, pilot installs, and paid scopes.\r\nObjectives (90 Days)\r\n1) Close 2–4 paid scopes (grant prep, preliminary SOWs, acoustic basis‑of‑design) totaling\r\n$10–20K.\r\n2) Secure 1 manufacturer MOU or prototype quote for convertible pews; advance 2 others\r\nto feasibility.\r\n3) Build a short list of 3 bondable church GCs in the Carolinas willing to price SIP shells and\r\nsafe‑room basements.\r\n4) Submit/prepare at least 1 safe‑room/refuge grant package with fixed fees.\r\n5) Ship a MapArea demo that produces client‑ready PDF reports (polygons, photos, notes).\r\nWorkstreams &amp; Actions\r\nA. Manufacturer – Convertible Pew (Provisional Filed)\r\nGoal: Convert interest into a prototype and scalable pricing.\r\nActions:\r\n• Use clean line art (no captions) + 1‑page tech spec.\r\n• State active demand: target purchase ~400 seats for a near‑term chapel.\r\n• Request: prototype quote, unit pricing by length, lead time, finishes.\r\n• Licensing options: upfront license + per‑unit royalty, or project fee per specified install.\r\n• Deliverable: Manufacturer sheet and spec (already drafted) + grant tie‑in one‑pager.\r\nB. Contractor – Church GCs with SIP Capability (Bondable)\r\nGoal: Build a partner bench for pricing SIP shells, P‑361/ICC‑500 basements, and\r\ncoordinated MEP/acoustics.\r\nActions:\r\n• Cold call using capability pitch (no client named). Follow with 1‑page contractor brief.\r\n• Verify bonding capacity (target: 100% performance bond at $3–4M project scale).\r\n• Ask f"
