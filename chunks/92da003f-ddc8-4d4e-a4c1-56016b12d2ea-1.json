  "content": "tigate sewer, water, electrical, and gas/alternative energy service options.\r\n\r\n3. Commission a combined boundary and topographic survey.\r\n4. Retrieve FEMA maps, historical site data, and any prior elevation certificates.\r\n5. Draft a preliminary lot layout for proposed structures and amenities.\r\n6. Package all information for the engineer’s modeling and permit application work.\r\nCost Efficiency\r\nBy completing substantial pre-engineering work, the licensed engineer can focus solely on\r\ntechnical modeling, design, and permitting, avoiding costly field visits and delays. This\r\napproach minimizes total project costs while expediting the permitting process.\r\nAppendix A – Preliminary Cost Notes\r\nNote: Cost ranges for engineering, surveying, and permitting will be determined once utility\r\navailability and site constraints are confirmed. These will be filled in after initial inquiries\r\nand survey bids are received."
