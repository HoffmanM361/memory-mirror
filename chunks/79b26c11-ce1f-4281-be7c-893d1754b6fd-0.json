By providing\r\nhigh-quality, targeted grant proposals, we position ourselves as indispensable partners to\r\nhousing authorities, municipalities, agricultural groups, and private sector vendors. Each\r\ngrant serves as a bridge to deeper collaboration and can underwrite the launch or\r\nexpansion of our core initiatives, including PHA development, traceability programs, and\r\nrefuge chapel/vendor models.\r\n5.2 Target Grant Types\r\n- Housing Development: Federal and state programs, including HUD and state housing\r\nfinance agencies.\r\n- Food Security &amp; Community Gardens: USDA programs (e.g., RFSP, UAIP), urban agriculture\r\ninitiatives.\r\n- Infrastructure &amp; Resilience: FEMA hazard mitigation, EPA water management grants.\r\n- Technology &amp; Innovation: SBIR/STTR, USDA tech adoption grants, blockchain traceability\r\nfunding.\r\n- Vendor &amp; Workforce Support: Grants that help vendors adapt to new markets.\r\n5.3 Prospecting Process\r\nWe systematically identify, track, and evaluate grant opportunities based on fit, deadline,\r\nand strategic alignment. AI-powered research tools streamline prospecting by scanning\r\nmultiple funding databases, while our internal CRM manages deadlines, application\r\nprogress, and contacts. For public agencies, we prioritize programs with flexible use of\r\nfunds to match our development model.\r\n5.4 Pricing and Engagement Models\r\n- Retainer Model: Monthly fixed fee for ongoing grant prospecting and submissions.\r\n- Success Fee Model: Payment tied to grant award.\r\n- Hybrid Model: Reduced retainer plus success fee, balancing commitment and performance\r\nincentives.\r\n5.5 Integration with Other Projects\r\nGrant writing is embedded across all major initiatives:\r\n- PHA Development: Funds for site planning, infrastructure, and mixed-use community\r\nspaces.\r\n- T"
