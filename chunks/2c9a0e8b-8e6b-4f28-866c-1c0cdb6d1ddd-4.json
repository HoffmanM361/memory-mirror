Compliance Pathway\r\n5.1 Required Permits and Approvals\r\nFloodplain Development Permit - City of Hattiesburg per Code ยง4-28\r\nNo-Rise Certification - Professional Engineer analysis per 44 CFR ยง60.3(d)(3)\r\nBuilding Permits - Standard municipal approvals\r\nNFIP Compliance - Flood insurance requirements\r\nPotential USACE Section 404 Permit - Wetlands jurisdiction review (parcels abut watercourse)\r\nNEPA Compliance - Environmental review if federal permits required\r\n5.2 Engineering Deliverables\r\nHydraulic Analysis: Demonstrating zero rise in flood levels\r\nStructural Engineering: Foundation and anchoring design to BFE + 2 feet\r\nFlood-Resistant Design: ASCE 24 compliance\r\nElevation Certificates: Post-construction verification\r\nCompensatory Storage Analysis: If required by local ordinance\r\n6. Conclusions\r\n6.1 Feasibility Determination\r\nConclusion: Development is feasible under federal, state, and local regulations with proper engineering compliance.\r\n\r\nEngineering Caveat: While regulatory analysis confirms development is legally permissible, the extent of buildable area within each parcel requires detailed civil engineering analysis.\r\n\r\n6.2 Engineering Determination Required\r\nGIS Analysis Limitations: Our Python/GIS analysis accurately identifies flood zone intersections but cannot determine:\r\n\r\nPrecise floodway boundaries at the parcel level\r\nSpecific areas where \"no-rise\" is achievable\r\nBuildable vs. non-buildable portions within each parcel\r\nOptimal placement for elevated structures\r\nProfessional Survey Required: Even if preliminary estimates suggest portions may be unbuildable, the actual buildable area can only be determined through:\r\n\r\nDetailed topographic survey by licensed surveyor\r\nHydraulic modeling by professional engineer\r\nSite-specific no-rise analysis for proposed structures\r\nMicro-siting analysis for optimal development placement\r\n6.3 Municipal Estimat"
