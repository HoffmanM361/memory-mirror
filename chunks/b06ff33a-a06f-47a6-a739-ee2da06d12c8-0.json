It captures the context, technical considerations,\r\naudience targeting, sales funnel design, and long-term retention strategies.\r\n1. Context &amp; Current Status\r\nThe Mapping Program is already built as a web application that can produce detailed\r\nreports including property dimensions, GPS walking paths, satellite imagery, and\r\ndownloadable formats such as GeoJSON, KML, Shapefile, and QGIS packages. The program is\r\nfunctional in its online form but is not yet wrapped as an Android application and does not\r\ncurrently support offline operation. The planned offline approach would allow users to pre-\r\ncache maps while connected to the internet and then verify or map properties on-site\r\nwithout active connectivity.\r\n2. Potential Market Applications\r\nWhile originally conceived with agricultural compliance in mind, the Mapping Program has\r\nbroader commercial potential. Potential audiences include:\r\n- Real estate professionals (realtors, appraisers, developers)\r\n- Land management users (gardeners, landscapers, survey hobbyists)\r\n- Small business operators (event planners, contractors)\r\n- Civic groups (neighborhood associations, local historians)\r\nThe software’s combination of GPS tracking, photo integration, and geospatial exports\r\nmakes it useful for anyone interested in measuring, documenting, or analyzing parcels of\r\nland.\r\n3. Technical Considerations\r\nThe current implementation leverages ESRI satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap layers.\r\nThere is potential for global coverage, although initial focus is likely to be on U.S.-based\r\nusers. An Android wrapper could be developed to package the web app into a"
