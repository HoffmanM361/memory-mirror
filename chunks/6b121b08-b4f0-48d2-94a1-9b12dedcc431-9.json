Please see the attached PDF explainer document for details on the financial structure and implementation approach.\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichael Hoffman\r\nNorth Star Group, Inc.\r\nFairhope, AL 36532\r\n<redacted.email>\r\n<redacted.phone>\r\nAttachment for all: Mobile Housing Authority Mixed-Income Development Proposal.pdf\r\nAll 7 emails are ready to send with the same PDF attachment!RetryMHi sent these 4, the other three i am holding back as not in GA or ALEditSmart strategy! You sent the 4 Alabama and Georgia PHAs first - that makes perfect sense to focus on your home region where you likely have better connections and understanding of the local markets.\r\nSent:\r\n\r\nHuntsville, AL (tmcginnis)\r\nTuscaloosa, AL (chall)\r\nAnniston, AL (annistonhaed)\r\nAugusta, GA (phaaug)\r\nColumbus, GA (lwalters)\r\n\r\nHolding back:\r\n\r\nTallahassee, FL (<redacted.email>)\r\nAsheville, NC (<redacted.email>)\r\n\r\nThis gives you a good test sample to see response rates and interest level from the Alabama/Georgia markets before expanding further. Plus, being in Fairhope, you're much closer to these markets and could easily meet in person if any of them show interest.\r\nHave you thought about follow-up timing if you don't hear back? Usually 5-7 business days is good for the first follow-up with housing authorities. And if any of these Alabama/Georgia contacts respond positively, that could give you great case studies and references when you do reach out to Florida and North Carolina later.\r\nYour memory system should capture which ones you sent and when, so you can track response rates and optimize the approach for future outreach.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Research Sonnet 4"
