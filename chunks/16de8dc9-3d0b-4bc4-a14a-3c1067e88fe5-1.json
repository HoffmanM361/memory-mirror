The conversion eliminates the need for separate sleeping equipment while\r\nmaintaining traditional seating aesthetics.\r\nIn the primary embodiment, the backrest is completely removable, sliding out of retention features\r\nand repositioning manually onto the seat platform to form a sleeping surface. Alternative\r\nembodiments employ various hinge, pivot, slide, or other positioning mechanisms.\r\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\r\nPrimary Embodiment - Removable Backrest System with Magnetic Security\r\nThe seating unit comprises a seat platform supported by end structural members, with an oversized\r\nbackrest panel that can be completely removed and repositioned. The primary embodiment\r\nincorporates a magnetic security system to prevent unauthorized access while allowing rapid\r\nprofessional deployment.\r\nSeat Platform Structure: The seat platform may be approximately 17-18 inches above floor level in\r\nsome embodiments, though other heights may be used. The platform may be 18-20 inches deep in\r\nsome embodiments, or other depths as appropriate. Traditional pew seats are typically angled rather\r\nthan horizontal, creating a sloped surface. The platform provides a stable base for both seating and\r\nthe repositioned backrest panel.\r\nEnd Support Members: End support members provide structural support and may take various forms\r\nincluding decorative end panels, simple legs, framework structures, or other configurations. In some\r\nembodiments, end support members may include hollow sections for storage. In other embodiments,\r\nthey may be solid. Heights may vary to accommodate different backrest sizes.\r\nRemovable Backrest Panel with Leveling Ribs: In the primary embodiment, the backrest panel is\r\ncompletely d"
