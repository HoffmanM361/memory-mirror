The mapping component is adaptable: it can be integrated\r\ninto agricultural programs, used for rain garden site selection, or deployed as a commercial\r\nsubscription product.\r\n4.2 Traceability Strategy\r\nThe primary focus is to meet and exceed upcoming traceability requirements from the\r\nEuropean Union (2025â€“2026) and any applicable U.S. regulations. The system is already\r\noperational in a proof-of-concept form in Africa, demonstrating our ability to capture\r\ngeospatial farm boundaries, attach photographic and quality data, and generate export-\r\ncompliant records. Our approach is designed for low-connectivity environments and\r\nleverages mobile caching to allow data collection offline with later synchronization.\r\nFunding efforts will highlight our compliance-readiness, operational track record, and the\r\nscalability of the technology to meet both agricultural and environmental monitoring needs.\r\nThe technology stack supports multiple use cases, including certification verification,\r\npesticide residue screening, and supply chain transparency.\r\n4.3 Mapping Program Strategy\r\nThe mapping program currently supports ESRI satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data\r\nlayers. It can function globally where internet access is available and can cache relevant\r\nmap tiles for offline use. The program has immediate applications in property boundary\r\nverification, rain garden site selection, and agricultural parcel documentation.\r\nWhile mapping is not the primary offering for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), it is a\r\nvalue-add feature in contexts where community garden plann"
