These records can then trigger smart contracts for payment and\r\ngenerate producer-facing market profiles.\r\n\r\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\r\n1. Integrated Workflow Overview\r\n\r\nIn one embodiment, the system comprises multiple interoperable modules: Field Data Capture\r\nModule, Pesticide Verification Module, Tamper-Evident Custody Seal Module, Continuous Compliance\r\nMonitoring Module, and Blockchain Market Enablement Layer. These modules are combined in a single\r\nprocess flow so that each data capture point, whether novel or known, feeds into the same immutable\r\ncustody record.\r\n2. Field Data Capture Module\r\nIn one embodiment, a portable computing device (e.g., Android smartphone) is used to capture site\r\nboundary data using GNSS-based mapping. While mapping technology is known, in this system it is\r\nintegrated as the first step in a continuous verification process that also includes chemical testing,\r\ntamper-evident sealing, compliance monitoring, and blockchain-based custody management. The\r\ndevice may cache map data offline and later synchronize. The module also captures geotagged images\r\nin uncompressed RAW or DNG formats to preserve evidentiary quality, along with optional identity\r\nverification of the producer.\r\nIn another embodiment, higher-accuracy GNSS positioning may be achieved using a Real Time\r\nKinematic (RTK) system with a base station mounted to a motorcycle or other mobile platform. The\r\nbase station may be powered by a generator integrated with the motorcycle and may use\r\n\r\ncommercially available components. This embodiment may be deployed in contexts requiring sub-\r\nmeter accuracy, while still feeding position data into the same integrated verification and blockchain\r\n\r\ncustody process described herein.\r\nIn a further embodiment, the module may incorporate well-known, state-of-the-art plant health\r\ndiagnostic tools, including machine learning-based visual a"
