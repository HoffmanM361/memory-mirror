Fiscal Efficiency and Resilience\r\n• Elevated modular homes in the project are 40–50% less costly per unit to build than traditional site-built\r\nhomes in comparable flood-prone areas.\r\n• Incorporating solar, rain catchment, and aquaponics reduces long-term utility loads—saving residents\r\nhundreds annually and lightening city utility infrastructure pressure.\r\n• By concentrating housing, jobs, and nature-based infrastructure in one site, the project will generate\r\nongoing tax revenue while reducing municipal exposure to flood response and emergency costs.\r\nPublic-Private Partnership & MOU Strategy\r\nA formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the development team, the City of Hattiesburg, and\r\nForrest County will formalize shared responsibilities, streamline regulatory coordination, and unlock multi-level\r\nfunding. This agreement will serve as a roadmap for delivering infrastructure, housing affordability, and long-term\r\ncommunity benefits—while de-risking implementation for all parties.\r\n\r\nEstablishing the MOU will help the City and County:\r\n• Capture competitive federal and state grants by demonstrating shovel-readiness and intergovernmental\r\nalignment\r\n• Avoid siloed permitting or piecemeal reviews, accelerating infrastructure and housing delivery\r\n• Ensure affordability benchmarks, equity safeguards, and maintenance responsibilities are clearly assigned\r\nand transparent\r\n• Maximize return on ARPA and CDBG dollars, with housing and public infrastructure that will serve the\r\nregion for decades\r\nPartner Key Contributions\r\nCity of Hattiesburg CUP/PUD approvals, zoning and land-use alignment, ARPA allocation, fee waivers,\r\n\r\nmarina grading, and trail integration coordination\r\n\r\nForrest County CDBG infrastructure funding, drainage engineering, HOME/ESG applications,\r\n\r\nconstruction staging and public access easements\r\n\r\nState of Mississippi MOSTF recreation grants, MDA infrastructure incentives, workfor"
