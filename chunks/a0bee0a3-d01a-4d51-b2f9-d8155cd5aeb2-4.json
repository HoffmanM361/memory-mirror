User Experience Validation: The 30-use limit creates just enough friction to identify users who derive real value from the system without being so restrictive that it prevents proper evaluation.\r\n\r\n4. Scalable Foundation: Stripe handles payment processing, subscription management, tax compliance, and international billing. As you grow, they scale with you automatically.\r\n\r\n5. Clean Separation of Concerns: The usage tracking and billing logic can be cleanly separated into modules that don't interfere with your core conversation management functionality.\r\n\r\nRevenue Projections and Market Validation\r\nAt $5/month, you only need 20 paying subscribers to generate $1,200 annually, which covers hosting costs and validates that you've built something people find valuable. More importantly, users who pay are giving you direct feedback about which features matter most for retention and expansion.\r\n\r\nThe freemium model also creates a natural customer development pipeline:\r\n\r\nFree users help you identify the most valuable use cases\r\nConversion friction points highlight feature gaps\r\nPaying users become your best feature request source\r\nUsage patterns inform future development priorities\r\nImplementation Timeline\r\nWeek 1: Usage tracking and database modifications Week 2: Stripe integration and upgrade flows\r\nWeek 3: UI integration and testing Week 4: Launch freemium model\r\n\r\nLong-term Strategic Benefits\r\nOnce you have paying customers and usage data, you'll be in a much stronger position to make informed decisions about:\r\n\r\nWhich features to build next\r\nWhether architectural changes are needed\r\nHow to price additional tiers or features\r\nWhether to pursue additional market segments\r\nThe alternative - reorganizing the codebase first - delays all of this learning and revenue generation without providing clear benefits to your curre"
