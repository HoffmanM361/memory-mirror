The system demonstrates solid engineering principles with proper authentication, user isolation, database management, and a clean Flask blueprint architecture. Most importantly, it's already working and being used.\r\n\r\nGiven this foundation, I strongly recommend pivoting to a freemium monetization model immediately rather than pursuing additional architectural reorganization. The technical debt of restructuring would delay revenue generation while your current system is perfectly positioned to validate market demand and generate income.\r\n\r\nWhy Freemium Makes Strategic Sense Now\r\nYour Memory System sits at the intersection of several high-value use cases that users are already experiencing pain around:\r\n\r\nDeveloper Workflow Optimization: Developers constantly lose track of working prompts, code snippets, and debugging conversations across different AI tools\r\nBusiness Knowledge Management: Teams need searchable archives of decision-makin"
