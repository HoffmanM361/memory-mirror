  "content": "etachable from the seating unit. The panel may be approximately 30 inches in height in\r\nsome embodiments, providing adequate width when repositioned horizontally for sleeping. In other\r\nembodiments, heights may be 24 inches, 28 inches, 32 inches, 36 inches, or other dimensions as\r\nappropriate.\r\nThe backrest length may span the full seating unit width, which may be 72 inches, 75 inches, 84 inches,\r\nor other lengths in various embodiments. Panel thickness may range from Â½ inch to 2 inches or more.\r\nCritical Innovation - Angle Compensation Ribs: The backrest panel incorporates built-in ribs,\r\ncontours, or structural elements on one surface designed to compensate for the angled seat platform\r\nwhen the panel is repositioned horizontally. These ribs may be:Tapered wooden strips running lengthwise\r\nMolded contours in composite panels\r\nAdjustable leveling elements\r\nFoam or padding shaped to create level surface\r\nMetal ribs or framework\r\nCombinations of leveling methods\r\nWhen the backrest panel is placed horizontally on the angled seat, these ribs create a level sleeping\r\nsurface suitable for standard mattresses. The ribs eliminate the need for custom-shaped mattresses\r\nand allow use of ordinary bedding.\r\nMagnetic Security System: The primary embodiment employs a magnetic locking system to prevent\r\nunauthorized manipulation while allowing rapid professional deployment:\r\nMagnetic Latch Configuration:\r\nStrong permanent magnets (rare earth magnets in some embodiments) embedded in backrest\r\npanel\r\nCorresponding magnetic plates or ferrous metal targets in end support members\r\nMagnetic strength sufficient to resist casual manipulation (50-200 pounds pull force in various\r\nembodiments)\r\nMultiple magnetic contact points for redundant security\r\nSecurity Release Mechanism:\r\nSpecific release magnet required for disengagement\r\nRelease magnet must be positioned at specific location(s)\r\nSpecific gesture or motion sequence required (lift, twist, pull combination in some embodiments)\r\nSyste"
