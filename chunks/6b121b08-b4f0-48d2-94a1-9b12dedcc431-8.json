With Asheville's booming tourism industry, healthcare sector growth, and increasing cost of living, there's significant need for both workforce housing and affordable housing solutions.\r\nUnlike traditional approaches, this model doesn't rely on Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, making it more straightforward to implement.\r\nKey Benefits:\r\n\r\nDeveloper fee revenue directly to your housing authority\r\nVery low-cost affordable housing production\r\nHigh, consistent cash flow generation\r\nFollows best practices for public housing authorities that have diversified their portfolio, which according to Novogradac CPA firm are \"in much better shape to weather potential storms\" and demonstrate \"the power of diversification and the power of a growth mindset in terms of trying to provide housing needs in a variety of ways and not solely reliant on HUD funding\"\r\n\r\nThe model creates mixed-income communities that serve Asheville's essential workforceâ€”teach"
