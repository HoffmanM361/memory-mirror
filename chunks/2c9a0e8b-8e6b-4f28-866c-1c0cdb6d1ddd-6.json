The regulatory framework permits development, but the extent and configuration must be determined through site-specific engineering.\r\n\r\nTechnical Methodology: Python/GIS analysis of MARIS DFIRM data\r\nRegulatory Research: Federal CFR, Mississippi Administrative Code, Municipal Ordinances\r\n\r\nRicky is a python person, here is a snippet of the python file I  used.
