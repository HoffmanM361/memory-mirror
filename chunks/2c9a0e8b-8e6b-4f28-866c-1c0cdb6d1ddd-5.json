  "content": "es vs. Engineering Reality\r\nCity Guidance: Municipal staff may provide general estimates based on:\r\n\r\nDesktop review of flood maps\r\nGeneral policy guidelines\r\nConservative preliminary assessments\r\nEngineering Analysis: Actual buildability requires:\r\n\r\nField survey data (precise elevations, topography)\r\nHydraulic modeling of specific development scenarios\r\nNo-rise certification for actual proposed structures\r\nSite-specific design optimization\r\nCritical Point: Municipal estimates should be treated as preliminary guidance only. The definitive determination of buildable area requires professional engineering analysis that cannot be determined \"on the fly.\"\r\n\r\n6.4 Key Requirements Summary\r\nNo-Rise Certification by Mississippi PE\r\nElevated construction above BFE + freeboard\r\nFlood-resistant design per ASCE 24\r\nMunicipal permit compliance\r\nNFIP flood insurance requirements\r\n6.5 Competitive Advantages\r\nProven coastal construction expertise applicable to riverine floodways\r\nStrong local housing demand in flood-prone areas\r\nMunicipal support for higher building standards\r\nInsurance benefits through elevated, compliant construction\r\n7. Engineering Analysis Requirements\r\n7.1 Limitations of GIS Analysis\r\nWhat Our Analysis Accomplished:\r\n\r\nConfirmed regulatory permissibility of floodway development\r\nIdentified flood zone intersections at parcel level\r\nVerified FEMA floodway designations\r\nMatched official FEMA flood mapping\r\nWhat Requires Professional Engineering:\r\n\r\nPrecise floodway boundaries within parcels\r\nBuildable area calculations based on hydraulic modeling\r\nNo-rise feasibility for specific development scenarios\r\nOptimal structure placement and design\r\nSite-specific elevation requirements\r\n7.2 Municipal Estimates vs. Engineering Reality\r\nImportant Distinction: Municipal staff estimates of \"non-buildable\" areas are:\r\n\r\nBased on general policy guidelines and desktop review\r\nUseful for preliminary planning purposes\r\nNOT definitive engineering determinations\r\nSubject to revisi"
