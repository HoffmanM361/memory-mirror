Purpose\r\nThe goal is to build a universal chat retrieval tool that enables users to store, organize, and reuse chat content from any platform, with minimal friction. This is aimed at:\r\n- Businesses that need to keep customer support or internal chat logs accessible.\r\n- Developers who want a searchable knowledge base from project discussions.\r\n- Everyday users who want to save important conversations for personal reference.\r\n\r\nThe system should work regardless of:\r\n- Which chat platform was used (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, SMS, Discord, etc.).\r\n- Whether the chats are ongoing or historical.\r\n- Whether the user wants to keep them private or share them selectively.\r\n\r\n2. Core Functions\r\n1. Import from Multiple Sources\r\n   - Manual upload of exported chats (TXT, JSON, CSV, HTML).\r\n   - Direct API or webhook integration where possible.\r\n   - Email-to-chat import for platforms without export APIs.\r\n\r\n2. Full-Text Search\r\n   - Keyword search across all imported conversations.\r\n   - Filtering by date, platform, participant, or tags.\r\n   - Context-aware search (grouping results by conversation thread).\r\n\r\n3. Tagging & Categorization\r\n   - Manual or automated tagging of conversations by topic or project.\r\n   - Ability to create persistent “collections” of related chats.\r\n\r\n4. Cross-Platform Output\r\n   - Copy or export relevant chat snippets into another platform.\r\n   - Format conversion (e.g., Slack markdown → HTML or plain text).\r\n\r\n5. Privacy & Security\r\n   - Local storage option with encryption for full control.\r\n   - Permission settings for shared retrieval systems (read-only, edit, admin).\r\n\r\n3. Optional Enhancements\r\n- Summarization: Condense long conversations into bullet points or executive summaries.\r\n- Thread Linking: Automatically link related threads from different platforms into a unified view.\r\n- Context-Preser"
