  "content": "r Memory System is already solving a real problem for real users. The engineering is solid, the user experience is functional, and the core value proposition is clear. This is exactly the right time to implement a freemium model and start learning from paying customers.\r\n\r\nThe 30-use limit creates natural urgency without being punitive, the $5 price point is low enough to minimize decision friction but high enough to filter for committed users, and the implementation path leverages all your existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nI recommend proceeding with the freemium implementation immediately. The market validation and revenue data you'll gather over the next 90 days will inform all future technical and product decisions much more effectively than architectural speculation.\r\n\r\nYour system is ready. Your users are ready. The market is ready. Let's monetize this solution and start building a sustainable business around the value you've already created."
