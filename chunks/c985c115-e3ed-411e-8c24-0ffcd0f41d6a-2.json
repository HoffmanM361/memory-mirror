While these plant diagnostic methods are not novel by\r\nthemselves, integrating their results into the blockchain custody record provides buyers with\r\nadditional quality and sustainability data. Other non-exclusive support functions may be included, such\r\nas weather condition logging, soil moisture recording, or other environmental metrics useful to the\r\nproducer and supply chain stakeholders.\r\n3. Pesticide Verification Module\r\nIn one embodiment, the system includes an in-field assay process using a portable applicator (e.g.,\r\nbrush-tipped bottle) to apply a reagent to a sample. Results are visually compared against a\r\nstandardized color reference, which may include widely available consumer packaging for calibration.\r\nThe result is captured in RAW or DNG format, preserving color accuracy, and directly bound to the\r\nblockchain custody record of the associated batch. This ensures that chemical compliance data is part\r\nof the same unified record that contains mapping, seal, and monitoring data.\r\n\r\n4. Tamper-Evident Custody Seal Module\r\nIn one embodiment, numbered, tamper-evident seals are attached destructively to product containers\r\n(e.g., jute bags). A photograph of the seal in place, with the seal number visible, is captured with GPS,\r\ntimestamp, and device metadata embedded in the EXIF record. This image and metadata are stored in\r\nthe blockchain custody record. By combining seal verification with mapping, pesticide testing, and\r\nmonitoring, the system ensures continuous custody integrity.\r\n5. Continuous Compliance Monitoring Module (Sentinel Tower)\r\nIn one embodiment, a fixed or portable tower or mast equipped with imaging devices and AI models\r\nmonitors the production site for compliance indicators such as absence of children, proper PPE usage,\r\nand restricted-area controls.
