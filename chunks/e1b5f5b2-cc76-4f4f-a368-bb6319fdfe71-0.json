We can build modern homes with two clear\r\nconstruction paths.\r\nSIP (Structural Insulated Panel) manufacturers typically charge premium prices because the\r\nproduct is perceived as \"fancy,\" but with volume orders we can negotiate competitive pricing. The\r\nfundamental materials - foam core and OSB/MgO facings - are inexpensive to manufacture. This\r\napproach differs from our previous fourplex and multifamily analysis because we're building\r\nindividual units as single-family homes and pricing accordingly, avoiding the complexity and\r\nhigher costs of multifamily construction.\r\nIf we cannot achieve target SIP pricing through volume negotiations, we can fall back to\r\nstick-built construction using local contractors. While this approach won't deliver the same energy\r\nefficiency, the project economics remain viable.\r\nThe SIP panel approach offers significant advantages: superior energy efficiency allows us to\r\ninclude utilities in rent and profit from the efficiency gains, enhancing investor returns. This works\r\nacross various unit sizes and configurations.\r\nThere are no restrictions preventing condominiumization of this development. The units don't\r\nneed to look like traditional condominiums - they simply need to be legally structured as\r\ncondominiums. This provides both the funding mechanism and important market validation, as\r\nbuyer deposits are held in escrow until loan approval, offering downside protection.\r\n\r\nA_Leaf River Cluster Development - SIP Panel Condominium Project\r\nFor your property near Leaf River in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, we recommend cluster-style\r\ndevelopment with a mixed unit approach, preferentially using structural insulated panels for the\r\nadditional benefits.
